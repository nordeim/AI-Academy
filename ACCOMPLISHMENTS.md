# AI Academy - Accomplishments & Milestones

**Last Updated:** March 20, 2026
**Status:** Backend API Operational, Database Migrated, Ready for Frontend Integration

---

## Major Milestone Achievements

### ✅ Milestone 1: Deep Architecture Analysis & Validation
**Date:** March 20, 2026

Comprehensive review and validation of the AI Academy codebase against documented architecture:

- **Analyzed:** Project_Architecture_Document.md, GEMINI.md, README.md
- **Validated:** Frontend structure (Vite + React 19 SPA with 51 Shadcn components)
- **Validated:** Backend Django models (Course, Cohort, Enrollment, User with UUID primary keys)
- **Verified:** Design system compliance (60-30-10 color rule, sharp corners, Electric Indigo + Neural Cyan)
- **Confirmed:** Component hierarchy (sections/, components/ui/, components/layout/)

**Key Finding:** The codebase is production-ready for the hybrid integration phase, with intentional discrepancies documented (Vite vs Next.js, Tailwind v3 vs v4 philosophy).

### ✅ Milestone 2: Database Migration Fix & Backend Initialization
**Date:** March 20, 2026

**Critical Issue Resolved:** Environment variables not loading from `.env` file

#### Root Cause
- `python-dotenv` was installed but `load_dotenv()` was never called
- Django settings read `os.environ.get()` which returned empty values
- Result: PostgreSQL authentication failure

#### Fix Applied
**File:** `backend/academy/settings/base.py`
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# ... after BASE_DIR definition
load_dotenv(BASE_DIR / '.env')
```

#### Migrations Created
- `courses/migrations/0001_initial.py` - Category, Course, Cohort, Enrollment models
- `courses/migrations/0002_initial.py` - Foreign key relationships
- `users/migrations/0001_initial.py` - Custom User model

#### Database Tables Created (15 total)
```
✓ courses_category
✓ courses_course
✓ courses_course_categories (M2M)
✓ courses_cohort
✓ courses_enrollment
✓ users_user
✓ users_user_groups
✓ users_user_user_permissions
✓ auth_group, auth_permission
✓ django_admin_log, django_migrations, django_session
```

#### Sample Data Created
- **3 Categories:** AI Engineering, Machine Learning, Data Science
- **3 Courses:** AI Engineering Bootcamp, ML Mastery, Data Science Fundamentals
- **1 Cohort:** AI Engineering cohort (April 19 - June 14, 2026)
- **1 Instructor:** Jane Smith
- **1 Superuser:** admin@example.com / adminpass123

### ✅ Milestone 3: Django REST API Operational
**Date:** March 20, 2026

**Status:** API running on `http://localhost:8000`

#### API Endpoints Verified
| Endpoint | Status | Features |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `GET /api/v1/` | ✅ | API root with HATEOAS links |
| `GET /api/v1/courses/` | ✅ | List all published courses, pagination, filtering |
| `GET /api/v1/courses/{slug}/` | ✅ | Course detail with categories |
| `GET /api/v1/courses/{slug}/cohorts/` | ✅ | Custom action returning course cohorts |
| `GET /api/v1/categories/` | ✅ | List categories with course_count |
| `GET /api/v1/cohorts/` | ✅ | List cohorts with availability_status |
| `GET /api/v1/enrollments/` | ✅ | Authenticated user enrollments (empty) |
| `GET /admin/` | ✅ | Django admin panel accessible |

#### Features Tested
- ✅ **Filtering:** `?level=intermediate`, `?featured=true`
- ✅ **Search:** `?search=AI` across title, subtitle, description
- ✅ **Ordering:** By price, rating, created_at, enrolled_count
- ✅ **Pagination:** PageNumberPagination (20 items per page)
- ✅ **Serializer Switching:** CourseListSerializer vs CourseDetailSerializer
- ✅ **Custom Actions:** `/courses/{slug}/cohorts/` endpoint

#### Response Structure Verified
```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": [{
    "id": "81ef745e-...",
    "title": "AI Engineering Bootcamp",
    "price": "2499.00",
    "categories": [...],
    "is_featured": true
  }]
}
```

## Code Changes (Updates & Additions)

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `backend/academy/settings/base.py` - ENV Loading
**Lines Added:** 3
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# ...
load_dotenv(BASE_DIR / '.env')  # After BASE_DIR definition
```

**Impact:** Enables environment variable loading from `.env` file

#### 2. New Migration Files Created
- `backend/courses/migrations/0001_initial.py` (104 lines)
- `backend/courses/migrations/0002_initial.py` (45 lines)
- `backend/users/migrations/0001_initial.py` (46 lines)

**Impact:** Database schema fully defined and applied

#### 3. Sample Data Population
Created via Django shell:
- Categories with icons and colors
- Courses with full metadata (pricing, ratings, enrollment counts)
- Cohort with instructor assignment
- Superuser for admin access

## Enhancements & Fixes

### Fixes Applied

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `.env` not loading | **Critical** | Added `load_dotenv()` to base.py |
| Missing migrations | **Critical** | Generated with `makemigrations` |
| Database auth failure | **Critical** | ENV fix + migration combination |
| No sample data | **Medium** | Created 3 courses, 3 categories, 1 cohort |
| Django admin not configured | **Low** | Superuser created, models registered |

### Backend Infrastructure

| Component | Status | Configuration |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| PostgreSQL | ✅ Running | Docker container, port 5432 |
| Redis | ✅ Running | Docker container, port 6379 |
| MinIO | ✅ Running | Docker container, ports 9000-9001 |
| Django Dev Server | ✅ Running | Port 8000 |
| Debug Toolbar | ✅ Enabled | At `/__debug__/` |
| CORS | ✅ Configured | Allowing all origins in dev |

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Installing `python-dotenv` is not enough; must call `load_dotenv()`
   - Django settings should load `.env` before any `os.environ.get()` calls
   - Use `BASE_DIR / '.env'` for reliable path resolution

2. **Database Initialization**
   - Running migrations requires both `makemigrations` (create) and `migrate` (apply)
   - Custom User models must be migrated before admin will work
   - Docker PostgreSQL credentials must match `.env` exactly

3. **API Design**
   - DRF's DefaultRouter provides clean URL structure
   - Custom `@action` decorators enable semantic endpoints like `/courses/{slug}/cohorts/`
   - ReadOnlyModelViewSet is appropriate for public course data

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - API endpoints should be tested with curl/httpie before integration
   - Sample data makes development and testing much easier
   - Django shell is powerful for data creation and debugging

### Process Lessons

1. **Systematic Debugging**
   - Always verify the simplest layer first (env vars → database → Django → API)
   - Use `python manage.py check` before migrations
   - Test database connectivity independently of Django

2. **Documentation**
   - Real implementation often differs from documentation
   - Update AGENTS.md with discovered discrepancies
   - Keep troubleshooting guides for future reference

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Backend Issues

#### Issue: "password authentication failed for user"
**Symptoms:** `psycopg.OperationalError: password authentication failed`
**Cause:** `.env` file not loaded
**Fix:**
```python
# Add to backend/academy/settings/base.py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(BASE_DIR / '.env')
```

#### Issue: "relation 'users_user' does not exist"
**Symptoms:** Migration error on admin.0001_initial
**Cause:** Missing custom app migrations
**Fix:**
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations users courses api
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Issue: Django cannot connect to PostgreSQL
**Symptoms:** Connection refused or timeout
**Check:**
```bash
# Verify Docker containers
docker ps

# Test connection manually
PGPASSWORD=academy_secret psql -h localhost -U academy_user -d academy_db -c "SELECT 1"
```

#### Issue: API returns empty results
**Symptoms:** `{"count": 0, "results": []}`
**Cause:** No published courses in database
**Fix:**
```bash
python manage.py shell
>>> from courses.models import Course
>>> Course.objects.filter(status='published').count()
# If 0, create sample data or change status
>>> Course.objects.update(status='published')
```

### Frontend Issues

#### Issue: Cannot connect to backend API
**Symptoms:** CORS errors or connection refused
**Check:**
1. Backend running: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/`
2. CORS settings in `backend/academy/settings/development.py`
3. Frontend API URL in `.env` file
